# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lena
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 15, Thursday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started doing the FreeCodeCamp Exercises. I'm getting up 1,5 hours earlier everyday, so I can code in the morning before work. 

### R1D2 - R1D4
Did the first 100 FreeCodeCamp Exercises.

### R1D5
Worked on the tribute page for freeCodeCamp on CodePen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/zWoxrQ/). I covered the basics but am not fully happy with it. I'll have to work on it to fix some stuff.

### R1D6
The next FCC-challenge ist to build a portfolio page on CodePen and I started that today. I gave up on Bootstrap and started just using Flexbox. Currently fucking around a lot. (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/xWqVgw/)
Learned using Font Awesome Icons.

### R1D7
Didn't go as well as I planned. I forked yesterdays portfolio to start over with bootstrap. BS-dropdown menu didn't work and I couldn't figure out why so I started building a new one from  the ground up. 

### R1D8
Finally finished the header and menu. Found the "Projects"-area on CodePen and I'm going to build my portfolio page there. 

### R1D9
I kind of finished the portfolio page in codepen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/pen/LdyEMw). I imported the needed JavaScript-Files, though I don't really understand how, yet. I just copied it from someone elses project. I guess I'll learn that later.
Now I can finally work on something else.

### R1D10
Continued with freeCodeCamp. Got into javascript. I'm really tired so its good I already know the basics of prgramming from learning Python. It's fun, I'd like to keep on doing it, but I really can't concetrate anymore.

### R1D11
Continued learning JavaScript on freeCodeCamp. Learned using the switch statement.

### R1D12
Some more JavaScript on fCC. Used nested arrays and dictionaries and how to access them.

### R1D13
Learned for- and while loops in JavaScript. Also I learned how to generate random numbers. I really don't understand the formula for random numbers in a range (Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min). Need to read more on that.

### R1D14
Javascript's getting harder now. FCC has some coding challenges and again I'm realizing, that even though I understand the basics, practicing it is a whole different thing.

### R1D15
Finished the palindrome-challenge on fCC and looking at other solutions and tips I'm learning to read other people's code â€“ which ist pretty hard. Also I learned that I'm still pretty stupid and need much more practice.


### R1D16
After about 8 hours of designing stuff for a friend I managed to do another algorithm challenge. I solved it pretty quickly which made me really happy. The next challenge was harder and I didn't solve it. I'll try again tomorrow, when I'm not as tired.

### R1D17
Didn't do much around easter weekend and skipped a day. I failed some challenges on sunday. 
Today I managed some algorithm challenges on fCC and it went pretty well.

### R1D18
Did some more algorithm challenges on fCC. Went okay, but  I can't seem to get it exactly right without help.

### R1D19 
Went pretty badly. Tried to understand how to filter an array with Boolean objects and I don't understand a thing. There's a knot in my brain. I'm going to stop now to repair my bike.

### R1D20
Understood the Boolean stuff from yesterday. But I'm having trouble with the new challenge on fCC. Maybe I'm just too stupid.


### R1D21
Took another break for a day and finished two challenges on fCC today. Maybe I'm not that stupid, but I still make many small mistakes.
