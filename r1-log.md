# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lena
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 15, Thursday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1
Started doing the FreeCodeCamp Exercises. I'm getting up 1,5 hours earlier everyday, so I can code in the morning before work.

### R1D2 - R1D4
Did the first 100 FreeCodeCamp Exercises.

### R1D5
Worked on the tribute page for freeCodeCamp on CodePen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/zWoxrQ/). I covered the basics but am not fully happy with it. I'll have to work on it to fix some stuff.

### R1D6
The next FCC-challenge ist to build a portfolio page on CodePen and I started that today. I gave up on Bootstrap and started just using Flexbox. Currently fucking around a lot. (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/xWqVgw/)
Learned using Font Awesome Icons.

### R1D7
Didn't go as well as I planned. I forked yesterdays portfolio to start over with bootstrap. BS-dropdown menu didn't work and I couldn't figure out why so I started building a new one from  the ground up.

### R1D8
Finally finished the header and menu. Found the "Projects"-area on CodePen and I'm going to build my portfolio page there.

### R1D9
I kind of finished the portfolio page in codepen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/pen/LdyEMw). I imported the needed JavaScript-Files, though I don't really understand how, yet. I just copied it from someone elses project. I guess I'll learn that later.
Now I can finally work on something else.

### R1D10
Continued with freeCodeCamp. Got into javascript. I'm really tired so its good I already know the basics of prgramming from learning Python. It's fun, I'd like to keep on doing it, but I really can't concetrate anymore.

### R1D11
Continued learning JavaScript on freeCodeCamp. Learned using the switch statement.

### R1D12
Some more JavaScript on fCC. Used nested arrays and dictionaries and how to access them.

### R1D13
Learned for- and while loops in JavaScript. Also I learned how to generate random numbers. I really don't understand the formula for random numbers in a range (Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min). Need to read more on that.

### R1D14
Javascript's getting harder now. FCC has some coding challenges and again I'm realizing, that even though I understand the basics, practicing it is a whole different thing.

### R1D15
Finished the palindrome-challenge on fCC and looking at other solutions and tips I'm learning to read other people's code â€“ which ist pretty hard. Also I learned that I'm still pretty stupid and need much more practice.


### R1D16
After about 8 hours of designing stuff for a friend I managed to do another algorithm challenge. I solved it pretty quickly which made me really happy. The next challenge was harder and I didn't solve it. I'll try again tomorrow, when I'm not as tired.

### R1D17
Didn't do much around easter weekend and skipped a day. I failed some challenges on sunday.
Today I managed some algorithm challenges on fCC and it went pretty well.

### R1D18
Did some more algorithm challenges on fCC. Went okay, but  I can't seem to get it exactly right without help.

### R1D19
Went pretty badly. Tried to understand how to filter an array with Boolean objects and I don't understand a thing. There's a knot in my brain. I'm going to stop now to repair my bike.

### R1D20
Understood the Boolean stuff from yesterday. But I'm having trouble with the new challenge on fCC. Maybe I'm just too stupid.

### R1D21
Took another break for a day and finished two challenges on fCC today. Maybe I'm not that stupid, but I still make many small mistakes.

### R1D22
Finally finished the algorithm challenges on fCC. Last one was a catastrophe. I'll have to learn more Javascript by doing challenges on Codewars or something.
Now I'm learning how to use JSON.

### R1D23
Building a Random Quote Machine for fCC. It's fun, I have to research stuff. I feel like building these webpages or apps on my own teaches me most.

### R1D24
Building the random Quote machine. Having problems with accessing random object properties. Found out how to install node.js and access it with shell, though.

### R1D25
Still working on the random quote machine. I managed to get a random quote, but couldn't work out how to correctly convert it to HTML. Using node in iTerm really helps figuring out stuff.

### R1D26
Still working on the random quote machine for fCC and somehow I can't get it to access a random object from an array. I either get all the quotes or undefined.

### R1D27
Finally used the fCC community to find a solution to my problem with the random quote machine and solved it. Now I'm fighting with the Twitter share button.

### R1D28
Random Quote Machine: Twitter share button still a problem. Can't get it to work and solutions of other people didn't work either. Found out you can do projects on github. That's awesome, I need to learn about that.

### R1D29 |
Finished the random quote machine yesterday (tweet-button works now). Wanted to create another project on codepen and found out that you can only have one if you use the free service. Started to learn how to use github. It's complicated, but pretty awesome.

### R1D30
Learning Git basics with learnenough.com, so I can use github for projects in the future.

### R1D31
Still learning Git and getting more comfortable with the command line

### R1D32
Just learned a bit of git.

### R1D33
Another day of learning git. I'm proud I kept going even though it's a weekend.

### R1D34
Finished the Learn Enough Git turorial. I'll start with the command-line and text-editor tutorials tomorrow.

### R1D35
After the git tutorial I finished the command line tutorial and started the text-editor tut.

### R1D36
Still on my detour to learn text-editor on learnenough.com. Already trying to use more github.

### R1D37
Finfished the text-editor turorial on learnenough.com
Tomorrow I'm going to get to work on the freeCodeCamp course again.
