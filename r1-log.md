# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lena
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 15, Thursday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started doing the FreeCodeCamp Exercises. I'm getting up 1,5 hours earlier everyday, so I can code in the morning before work. 

### R1D2 - R1D4
Did the first 100 FreeCodeCamp Exercises.

### R1D5
Worked on the tribute page for freeCodeCamp on CodePen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/zWoxrQ/). I covered the basics but am not fully happy with it. I'll have to work on it to fix some stuff.
