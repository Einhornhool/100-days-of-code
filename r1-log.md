# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lena
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 15, Thursday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started doing the FreeCodeCamp Exercises. I'm getting up 1,5 hours earlier everyday, so I can code in the morning before work. 

### R1D2 - R1D4
Did the first 100 FreeCodeCamp Exercises.

### R1D5
Worked on the tribute page for freeCodeCamp on CodePen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/zWoxrQ/). I covered the basics but am not fully happy with it. I'll have to work on it to fix some stuff.

### R1D6
The next FCC-challenge ist to build a portfolio page on CodePen and I started that today. I gave up on Bootstrap and started just using Flexbox. Currently fucking around a lot. (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/full/xWqVgw/)
Learned using Font Awesome Icons.

### R1D7
Didn't go as well as I planned. I forked yesterdays portfolio to start over with bootstrap. BS-dropdown menu didn't work and I couldn't figure out why so I started building a new one from  the ground up. 

### R1D8
Finally finished the header and menu. Found the "Projects"-area on CodePen and I'm going to build my portfolio page there. 

### R1D9
I kind of finished the portfolio page in codepen (https://codepen.io/Einhornhool/pen/LdyEMw). I imported the needed JavaScript-Files, though I don't really understand how, yet. I just copied it from someone elses project. I guess I'll learn that later.
Now I can finally work on something else.
